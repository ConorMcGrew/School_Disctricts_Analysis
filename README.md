# School_Disctricts_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis

We were tasked with helping Maria to analyze math and reading standarized test data. The data was sourced from a variety of school disctricts, and it is used to show trends in performance and budgets. This will eventually be used by the board of education and superintendent to inform future budgetary decisions.  

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

* How is the district summary affected?
* How is the school summary affected?
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

## Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
